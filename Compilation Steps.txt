Building Instructions

Dependency - SFML 2.5.1

1) Use the Makefile to compile and run the program.

2) If it does not work set up SFML 2.5.1 in root directory to your IDE and dynamically link the .dll files.

Compile main.cpp in the root directory and all the files within the headers/ folder and
link the following sfml flags with the compiler:
-lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio

Additionally, you can refer to the official SFML documentation(https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/) to build files on specific platforms.
